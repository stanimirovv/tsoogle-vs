# tsoogle-vs README

Tsoogle - like google but for your typescript project.
Find functions or methods by approximate signature - return type, argument types or both. Supports optional arguments, rest arguments and partial type checking.

Run the `Tsoogle Search` (cmd + shift + p and write Tsoogle)
A webview will be opened where you need to put the **absolute** filepath to your `tsconfig.json` file.
Then you can search for functions or methods using the tiny tsoogle query language.
Please refer to the tsoogle main repo for more information, how to query, etc.  https://github.com/stanimirovv/tsoogle
